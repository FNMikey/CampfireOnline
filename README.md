# 🔥 Minecraft Campfire Status Plugin

Hi!

This repository contains my **first Minecraft plugin**.
The plugin is **unfinished**, but it might still be useful to anyone starting their journey with **Minecraft modding**.

## 🌟 Idea

The concept behind this plugin is simple - each player gets assigned a **campfire**, and every time that player **joins the server**, their campfire is **lit on fire**.
This creates a **visual representation** inside your base or house, showing **who’s online** and who’s not.

## 🧩 Features

- Players can assign their own campfire
- Lights the campfire when a player joins

## 🛠️ Built With

- **Minecraft Spigot**
- **Java**
